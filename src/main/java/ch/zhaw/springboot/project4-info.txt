1. Domain Model: Our model includes five entities (5 db tables, 7 java entities) with many-to-many relationships and usage of a composite primary key in the Followers and FriendRequests entity.
2. Repositories: Our repositories include different domain specific select queries. Additionally we have implemented insert, update and delete queries. This enables a wider variety of operations in the database.
